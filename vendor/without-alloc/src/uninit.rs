/// Points to an uninitialized place but would otherwise be a valid reference.
///
/// This is a `&mut`-like struct that is somewhat of a pendant to `MaybeUninit`. It makes it
/// possible to deal with uninitialized allocations without requiring an `unsafe` block
/// initializing them and offers a much safer interface for partial initialization and layout
/// calculations than raw pointers.
///
/// Note that it also supports slices which means it does not use `MaybeUninit` internally but
/// offers conversion where necessary.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The basic usage is also interacting with `MaybeUninit`:
///
/// ```
/// # #[derive(Default)]
/// # struct MyStruct { };
/// use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
/// use without_alloc::Uninit;
///
/// let mut alloc: MaybeUninit<MyStruct> = MaybeUninit::uninit();
/// let uninit = Uninit::from_maybe_uninit(&mut alloc);
///
/// // notice: no unsafe
/// let instance: &mut MyStruct = uninit.init(MyStruct::default());
/// ```
///
/// But since we are working on arbitrary uninitialized memory it is also possible to reuse the
/// structure for completely arbitrary other types. Just note that there is no integrated mechanis
/// for calling `Drop`.
///
/// ```
/// use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
/// use without_alloc::Uninit;
///
/// // Just a generic buffer.
/// let mut alloc: MaybeUninit<[u32; 1024]> = MaybeUninit::uninit();
/// let uninit = Uninit::from_maybe_uninit(&mut alloc);
///
/// // Now use the first `u32` for a counter:
/// let mut counter = uninit.cast().unwrap();
/// let mut tail = counter.split_to_fit();
/// let counter: &mut u32 = counter.init(0);
///
/// // And some more for a few `u64`.
/// // Note that these are not trivially aligned, but `Uninit` does that for us.
/// let mut values = tail.split_cast().unwrap();
/// // No more use, so don't bother with `split_to_fit` and just `init`.
/// let values: &mut [u64; 2] = values.init([0xdead, 0xbeef]);
/// ```
