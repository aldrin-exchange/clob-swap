use crate::uninit::Uninit;

/// An allocated instance of a type.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// The basic usage are allocated recursive data structures. Here is a standard example using a
/// `Bump` with `'static` storage duration as the allocator:
///
/// ```
/// use without_alloc::{Box, alloc::LocalAllocLeakExt};
/// use static_alloc::Bump;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// enum List<T> {
///     Nil,
///     Cons(T, Box<'static, List<T>>),
/// }
///
/// static SLAB: Bump<[u8; 1024]> = Bump::uninit();
///
/// let base = SLAB.boxed(List::Nil).unwrap();
/// let one = SLAB.boxed(List::Cons(0, base)).unwrap();
/// let two = SLAB.boxed(List::Cons(1, one)).unwrap();
///
/// // We can destruct the value (not with `*` but comparable).
/// match Box::take(two).0 {
///     List::Cons(val, _)  => assert_eq!(val, 1), // Got the value back.
///     _ => unreachable!(),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Downsides
///
/// Unfortunately, this `Box` does not yet support unsizing. This is very unfortunate as it means
/// you can't use it for type erasure.
///
/// ## Design
/// You will likely notice quickly that this has different semantics than the `std::boxed::Box`.
/// Its inner pointer may be larger and it does not allocate nor deallocate memory on its own. This
/// only wraps a fully initialized `Uninit` in a RAII/`Drop` interface.
///
/// Of course, there is a reason for this choice. The standard `Box`, storing only the raw pointer
/// (as a `Unique`), requires its underlying allocation to have the *exact* same size and align
/// (`Layout`) as the value and the layout needs to be recalculated when deallocating. Without a
/// dependency on an allocator it would seem that the underlying layout becomes less important and
/// can be thrown away but the opposite is the case. Many converters for the `std::boxed::Box` rely
/// on being able to reallocate into a suitably constructed new allocation on will. Not having this
/// luxury at our disposal means there should be a mechanism to cope with mismatching allocations
/// anyways. So we simply store the full `Uninit` provided, relying on the library user to manage
/// other aspects of allocation for us.
///
/// Instead, this `Box` can offer additional ways to manipulate and massage the underlying
/// allocation. It should be possible to restore the exact allocation `Box` semantics (albeit with
/// one `usize` more space usage) via a wrapper when an allocator is available.
